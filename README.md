  What is Customer life time? - It is the amount spent by the customer during his relationship with the company

 Let's say A company spends 50 USD for acquiring a customer, That customer stays for 15 years with the company before churning or natural cause. This customer spent 100 USD per year to buy our service. In such cases Total customer life time value will be 

(15*100) - 50=1,450 

One quality of CLV models is. It has to be built on every 5 or 6 months to understand the additional data points associated with each customer.

If CLV is increasing every year, It means you as a company making your existing customer satisfied with your services. CLV is very important because companies have to spend huge amount of money in various ways to acquire a new customer.

  Ways to improve CLV-
	1. Utilize the freemium model - Let's say there is a customer using our Gaming Mobile app. If we have noticed, Game is free but after playing it for sometime, When we get addicted to it, We feel like buying new weapons to improve our gaming performance . And to do so We have to pay to get new upgraded weapon.  It is adding to our CLV 
	2. Creating a customer segmentation - We as a customer would not like to buy something which is not relevant to us hence pitching for something or sending email or message for something which they do not like will be waste of money. 
	3. Sending promotional Offers, Discount and Couple codes

CLV = Expected number of transaction *  Revenue per transaction * Margin

Expected Number of transaction is calculated using BG/NBD Model

Revenue per transaction is calculated using Gamma Gamma  model

Margin is proposed by Companies clients or business folks
