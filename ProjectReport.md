# What is customer life time value?
Customer life time value informs How much you should spend  on customer acquisition. In this project. I sorted customers based on their value like How much did they spend, How long have they been active, What was the recent purchase days, their average spending in a year etc. 

# How to calculate the CLV?
There are four KPIs to determine CLV. 
1. Average Order value
2. Purchase Frequency
3. Gross Margin
4. Churn Rate

CLV = AOV*F*GM*(1/CHURN)


# How to calculate AOV?
AOV = Total Sales Revenue / Total Number of orders

# How to calculate Purchase Frequency (F)
F = Total Sales revenue - Costs of products sold / Total sales revenue

# How to calculate Churn Rate?

Churn Rate = Number of customers at the end of the time period - Number of customers at the begining of the period / Number of customers at the Beginning of the time.


# How can we improve customer's life time value?

We can add personalized product recommendations to the site
the recommended products should be based on the ideal price point for each individual customer, thereby maximizing revenue.

Send personalized newsletter campaigns with dynamic product recommendations optimized for price
Trigger product recommendations, based on what they’ve added to their shopping cart, directly on the site.
Send an email campaign with product recommendations based on what they’ve added to their shopping cart.
Create product bundles that offer a discount for making a larger purchase. Bundle products that can be used together, and recommend the bundle directly on the site, or through email, based off the user’s browsing and shopping cart history.


# How to improve the purchase Frequency?
Sometime customers spend a lot, And We make huge margin but they just do not order often. To make customer purchase often we can try these steps

Communicate dynamically. Using historical customer data collected with a true unified Single Customer View, you can automatically send emails that arrive at the ideal time for each individual customer. (Make sure those emails are personalized!).
Find out if you’re communicating through the right channels – does this particular customer respond better to email or SMS? Make sure each customer receives your message through their preferred channel.
Segment your customers by their customer lifecycle stage, then re-engage with customers who haven’t purchased in a while, and are in danger of churning.
Use push notifications and banners to highlight time sensitive deals based off their browsing history.
Use banners that trigger when a customer enters and exits the site. Use these banners to recommend personalized products or sales.
